# HackRF-One 3D model
A HackRF-One standard black plastic case 3D model built from scratch with [FreeCAD](https://freecadweb.org). Based on pictures and real physical measures, trying to be as precise as possible (even replicating some of the "defects"). Useful for modelling arround it during integration in other projects.
